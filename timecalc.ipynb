    "* Times should be represented as datetime objects from the datetime module.\n",
    "* These need to be \"aware\" so must carry timezone infomation.\n",
    "* We now (as of python 3.9) have a way to find timezone infomation (including daylight saving changes) \n",
    "in IANA format via the timeinfo module. Prior to python 3.9 this was not in the standard libary.\n",
    "* Differences in times are represented as timedelta objects. These are returned when we subtract\n",
    "datetimes from each other.\n",
    "* We need to know when \"now\" is. This also needs to be timezone aware, so we choose to use UTC.\n",
    "* It is helpful to use the ISO (8601) format for reporting times and dates.\n",
